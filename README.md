The Model approach I am using is Mobilenet because it is the best among the model that I trained my data. This model perform well in training data which give around 92% accuracy.
I tested the other models but they have low performance accuracy which let me to chose Mobilenet.
In regard to the changes of the number of Epochs and batch size of the data, the model will still learn with Test accuracy around 90% to 92% in Mobilenet.
Therefore, I use the following number of Epochs and batch size:
Number of Epochs: 6
Number of batch_size: 32 and the gives the below test accuracy
Test Accuracy: 92.44%
